# Automatically Deploy Python Web Apps from Version Control to Cloud Run || [GSP1204](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/focuses/80415?parent=catalog) ||

## Solution [here](https://youtu.be/GpUp5nfEJPo)

**Prerequisites**

* If you do not already have a **GitHub** account, you will need to create a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup)

**Recommendations**

* Use an existing **GitHub** account if you have one. **GitHub** is more likely to block a new account as spam.

* Configure [two-factor authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication) on your GitHub account to reduce the chances of your account being marked as spam.

sudo chmod +x gsp1204-1.sh

./gsp1204-1.sh
```

* Go to **Clod Run** from [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/run)

### Run again the following Commands in CloudShell

```
curl -LO raw.githubusercontent.com/QUICK-GCP-LAB/2-Minutes-Labs-Solutions/main/Automatically%20Deploy%20Python%20Web%20Apps%20from%20Version%20Control%20to%20Cloud%20Run/gsp1204-2.sh
